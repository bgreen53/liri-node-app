## ABOUT THE APP
  LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. The user has the option of using four commands (listed below) in conjuntion with specific parameters associated with the commands. The  `Commands` are:

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

   ## HOW LIRI WORKS

   Users will search via command line for artists, songs, or movies using the corresponding command. LIRI will return a list of upcoming concerts, list of songs, or movie data based on the user's input. See the examples below:
